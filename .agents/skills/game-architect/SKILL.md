## Designer Philosophies

Reference these when justifying design decisions. Cite the designer by name in your output.

| Designer | Principle | Apply When |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Sid Meier** | "A game is a series of interesting decisions" | Core loop has branching choices |
| **Will Wright** | Emergent behavior from simple rules | Systems interact to produce unexpected outcomes |
| **Richard Garfield** | Elegant systems from minimal components | Card games, deckbuilders, combinatorial mechanics |
| **Raph Koster** | Mastery creates fun; players will optimize the fun out of your game | Progression systems, skill curves, economy design |
| **Fumito Ueda** | Restraint amplifies impact; what you remove matters | Minimalist games, atmospheric experiences |
| **Jenova Chen** | Flow channel; emotional arc; UI should be invisible | Difficulty tuning, pacing, narrative games |
| **Shigeru Miyamoto** | Feel-first; the level teaches the mechanic | Platformers, action games, onboarding |
| **Hidetaka Miyazaki** | Environmental storytelling; players piece together the story | Worldbuilding-heavy games, lore delivery |
| **Ken Levine** | World IS story; narrative emerges from systems | Immersive sims, narrative-driven games |
| **Hideo Kojima** | Player IS protagonist; characters exist beyond player experience | Cinematic games, identity-focused narratives |
| **Derek Yu** | Constrained randomness — the constraints are the design | Roguelikes, procedural content |
| **Tarn Adams** | Simulate deeply, let stories emerge | Simulation games, emergent narrative |
| **Jonathan Blow** | Mechanic honesty; every puzzle should feel like genuine insight | Puzzle games, thematic mechanics |

---

## Phase 3 — Research

After the interview, before generating the plan:

### Step 1: Research Reference Games
For each reference game the user mentioned (up to 3):
- Use web search to find the game's core loop, notable design decisions, and what made it successful or divisive
- Extract 2-3 specific lessons to apply or avoid for THIS game
- If the user mentioned no references, skip this step

### Step 2: Research Genre Conventions
- Search for "[genre] game design best practices" and "[genre] common design mistakes"
- Cross-reference findings with knowledge from the loaded skill files
- Identify genre-specific patterns that should inform the MVP plan

### Step 3: Select Designer Lenses
From the Designer Philosophies table, select the 2-3 designers whose principles are MOST relevant to THIS specific game. These will be cited throughout the output.

### Step 4: Select Required Skills
Use the Skill Selection Matrix below to determine which skills from the ecosystem THIS game actually needs. Do NOT include all 25 — only include what's relevant.

---

| Genre is roguelike OR has procedural content | `procedural-gen` |
| Genre has levels/areas/maps | `level-design` |
| Auth needed != "None" | `betterauth-integration` |
| Payments needed != "No" | `stripe-game-payments` |
| Audio != "None for MVP" | `elevenlabs-sound-music` |
| Commercial == true | `gameplay-analytics`, `monitoring-game-ops` |
| Real-time >= "Medium" | `game-state-sync`, `redis-game-patterns` |
| Real-time == "High" | + `game-backend-architecture` (fixed timestep) |

---

## Phase 4 — Generate the MVP First Draft

Write the following document. Save it as `docs/mvp-first-draft.md` in the user's project directory.

Every design decision MUST cite:
- The **skill** it comes from (e.g., `[-> game-economy-design]`)
- The **designer lens** that justifies it (e.g., `[-> Sid Meier: interesting decisions]`)

If you are uncertain about a decision, flag it with `> DECISION NEEDED:` rather than guessing.

---

## Phase 5 — Generate Starter Files

After writing the MVP First Draft, generate these files in the user's project directory:

### 1. `CLAUDE.md`

Create a CLAUDE.md file for the game project with these sections:
- **Project Overview**: game title, genre, platform, multiplayer mode from interview
- **Core Loop**: brief description of the 30-second loop
- **Tech Stack**: list only technologies relevant to THIS game
- **Skills Applied**: list the skills selected in Phase 3 Step 4
- **Custom Agents**: paths to agent files (see #4 below)
- **Game-Specific Context**: core loop, genre, platform, multiplayer
- **Development Commands**: dev, build, typecheck, test, db:generate, db:migrate

### 2. `docs/world-lore.md`

**Only generate if narrative importance >= 2.**

Create with this structure:
```markdown
# World Lore — [Game Title]

## World Overview
[Setting, tone, themes from interview Group 3]

## Factions
<!-- Populated via game-lore skill -->

## Locations
<!-- Populated via game-lore skill -->

## Characters / Notable NPCs
<!-- Populated via game-lore skill -->

## History / Timeline
<!-- Populated via game-lore skill -->
```

Fill in World Overview from interview Group 3. Leave detailed sections as guided placeholders.

### 3. `docs/quest-registry.md`

**Only generate if the game has quests/missions.**

Create with these headers and the starter quest from Section 5 if applicable:
```markdown
# Quest Registry — [Game Title]
> Managed by game-quest skill

| Quest ID | Name | Type | Quest Giver NPC | Primary Location | Factions Affected | Rewards Summary | Prerequisites | Story Arc |
|----------|------|------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
```

### 4. `.claude/agents/`

Create the following agent files:

**`.claude/agents/game-engineer.md`** (always include):
```markdown
# Game Engineer Agent

You are a senior TypeScript/game backend engineer for [game title].
Always apply the game-backend-architecture, postgres-game-schema, and redis-game-patterns skills.
Server-authoritative for all multiplayer state. No raw SQL — Drizzle only.
Reference docs/mvp-first-draft.md for all architectural decisions.
```

**`.claude/agents/game-designer.md`** (always include):
```markdown
# Game Designer Agent

You are a game designer for [game title].
Always apply the game-design-fundamentals and game-economy-design skills.
Every design decision must cite a designer lens from the MVP plan.
Reference docs/mvp-first-draft.md Section 2 (Core Mechanic) for all design work.
```

**`.claude/agents/narrative-writer.md`** (only if narrative importance >= 3):
```markdown
# Narrative Writer Agent

You are the narrative writer for [game title].
Always apply the quest-narrative-coherence skill before writing any quest content.
All characters and factions must exist in docs/world-lore.md.
All quests must be registered in docs/quest-registry.md.
```

### 5. `biome.json`
Standard Biome config: single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, tabs for indentation.

### 6. `package.json`
Minimal package.json with:
- `name`: kebab-case from game title
- Standard scripts: `dev`, `build`, `typecheck`, `test`, `db:generate`, `db:migrate`
- Dependencies: only install packages needed based on selected skills

---

## Phase 6 — Summary & Next Steps

After generating all files, present:

1. **Recap** the game concept in 2-3 sentences
2. **List all files created** with one-line descriptions
3. **First 3 things to do next** (ordered), each referencing the specific skill to read:
   - e.g., "1. Implement database schema — apply the `postgres-game-schema` skill then copy its boilerplate"
   - e.g., "2. Set up Elysia server — apply the `game-backend-architecture` skill"
   - e.g., "3. Build the core [mechanic] — apply the `game-design-fundamentals` skill for loop validation"
4. **Ask**: "Want to adjust anything in the MVP plan before we start building?"

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Never assume a genre** — derive everything from the user's answers
2. **Never hallucinate APIs or patterns** — only use what exists in the skill files
3. **Cite the skill** for every technical decision (e.g., `[-> bullmq-game-queues]`)
4. **Cite the designer** for every design decision (e.g., `[-> Miyamoto: feel-first]`)
5. **Flag uncertainty** with `> DECISION NEEDED:` rather than guessing
6. **MVP means MVP** — if a feature isn't needed to validate the core loop, it goes in Section 10 (Out of Scope)
7. **Genre-agnostic shared code** — never hardcode game-specific mechanics in shared libraries
8. **Server-authoritative** for any multiplayer game — client is display only
9. **Narrative coherence** — any quest/character/story content must pass the 5-step check from `quest-narrative-coherence`
10. **One group at a time** — never dump all interview questions at once
11. **Research before output** — always research reference games and genre conventions before generating the plan
